**Main goal: Leverage predictive modeling to enhance training effectiveness, injury prevention, and overall athlete performance**

*FitML* will be a model designed for the above main goal. It will recommend workouts, meals, and allow for scanning of meals.

**About Toro Fitness**
Built in Xcode, using SwiftUI. As for data management, I am using CoreData.
Tabs:
Hub - user receives an overview of their data, including Apple Watch metrics (specifically, steps, active calories, and basal calories). Future update will include recent workout, charts, and more.
Workouts - user can create, modify, and start a workout. Future update will include recommended workouts from "FitML".
Meals - user can log meals throughout the day. This will be added in a future update. FitML will also be added, allowing the user to take a picture of their meal and have it automatically logged, as well as recommended meals.
